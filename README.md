# lmaoPolice-bot
Discord bot that looks out for the misuse of 'lmao'. Will censor users who enter this illegal word.

## Lore:
'once in ages past people lived in much happier times.  People were so joys and full of laughter that they laughed all the time until some died.  Humour became such an illness that it was the leading cause of death.  A league of police was created to subvert the amount of laughter to bring down the death toll.  The good work of the police has helped curve society to safer times.  I am one in that league'
